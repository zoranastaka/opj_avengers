     * Quartiles - Exclusive method
     * Three points that divide the data set into four equal groups, each group comprising a quarter of the data.
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile
     *
     * 0% is smallest number
     * Q1 (25%) is first quartile (lower quartile, 25th percentile)
     * Q2 (50%) is second quartile (median, 50th percentile)
     * Q3 (75%) is third quartile (upper quartile, 75th percentile)
     * 100% is largest number
     * interquartile_range is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. (IQR = Q₃ - Q₁)
     *
     * Method used
     *  - Use the median to divide the ordered data set into two halves.
     *   - If there are an odd number of data points in the original ordered data set, do not include the median
     *     (the central value in the ordered list) in either half.
     *   - If there are an even number of data points in the original ordered data set,
     *     split this data set exactly in half.
     *  - The lower quartile value is the median of the lower half of the data.
     *    The upper quartile value is the median of the upper half of the data.
     *
     * This rule is employed by the TI-83 calculator boxplot and "1-Var Stats" functions.
     * This is the most basic method that is commonly taught in math textbooks.
