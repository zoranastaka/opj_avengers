     * Transpose matrix
     *
     * The transpose of a matrix A is another matrix Aᵀ:
     *  - reflect A over its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right) to obtain AT
     *  - write the rows of A as the columns of AT
     *  - write the columns of A as the rows of AT
     * Formally, the i th row, j th column element of Aᵀ is the j th row, i th column element of A.
     * If A is an m × n matrix then Aᵀ is an n × m matrix.
