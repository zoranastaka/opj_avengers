     * @test   Large 49x49 matrix with lots of zeros and small floating point values should be recognized as a singular matrix.
     *         The singular determination uses the determinant to see if it is zero.
     *         The determinant has to take in the floating point error tolerance, otherwise, smallNumber E-19 is not going to equal 0.
