     * This cache stores all its cache entries under one "cache" entry in a configurable backend.
     *
     * This comes handy for things that you need very often, nearly in every request. For example plugin metadata, the
     * list of tracker plugins, the list of available languages, ...
     * Instead of having to read eg. a hundred cache entries from files (or any other backend) it only loads one cache
     * entry which contains the hundred keys. Should be used only for things that you need very often and only for
     * cache entries that are not too large to keep loading and parsing the single cache entry fast.
     * All cache entries it contains have the same life time. For fast performance it won't validate any cache ids.
     * It is not possible to cache any objects using this cache.
     *
