     *
     * - `Auth.afterIdentify` - Fired after a user has been identified using one of
     *   configured authenticate class. The callback function should have signature
     *   like `afterIdentify(EventInterface $event, array $user)` when `$user` is the
     *   identified user record.
     *
     * - `Auth.logout` - Fired when AuthComponent::logout() is called. The callback
     *   function should have signature like `logout(EventInterface $event, array $user)`
     *   where `$user` is the user about to be logged out.
     *
     * @return array List of events this class listens to. Defaults to `[]`.
