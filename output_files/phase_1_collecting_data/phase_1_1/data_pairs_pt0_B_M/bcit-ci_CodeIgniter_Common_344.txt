	/**
	 * Function usable
	 *
	 * Executes a function_exists() check, and if the Suhosin PHP
	 * extension is loaded - checks whether the function that is
	 * checked might be disabled in there as well.
	 *
	 * This is useful as function_exists() will return FALSE for
	 * functions disabled via the *disable_functions* php.ini
	 * setting, but not for *suhosin.executor.func.blacklist* and
	 * *suhosin.executor.disable_eval*. These settings will just
	 * terminate script execution if a disabled function is executed.
	 *
	 * The above described behavior turned out to be a bug in Suhosin,
	 * but even though a fix was committed for 0.9.34 on 2012-02-12,
	 * that version is yet to be released. This function will therefore
	 * be just temporary, but would probably be kept for a few years.
	 *
	 * @link	http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/
	 * @param	string	$function_name	Function to check for
	 * @return	bool	TRUE if the function exists and is safe to call,
	 *			FALSE otherwise.
