     * Variance
     *
     * Variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out.
     * A variance of zero indicates that all the values are identical.
     * Variance is always non-negative: a small variance indicates that the data points
     * tend to be very close to the mean (expected value) and hence to each other.
     * A high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around the mean
     * and from each other.

     * σ² = ----------
     *          ν
     *
     * Generalized method that allows setting the degrees of freedom.
     * For population variance, set d.f. (ν) to n
     * For sample variance, set d.f (ν) to n - 1
     * Or use populationVariance or sampleVariance convenience methods.
     *
     * μ is the population mean
     * ν is the degrees of freedom, which usually is
     *   the number of numbers in the population set or n - 1 for sample set.
