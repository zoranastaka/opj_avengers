     * Population correlation coefficient
     * Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC or PCC or Pearson's r)
     *
     * A normalized measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y,
     * giving a value between +1 and −1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive correlation,
     * 0 is no correlation, and −1 is total negative correlation.
     * It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the degree of linear dependence
     * between two variables.

     *
     * The correlation coefficient of two variables in a data sample is their covariance
     * divided by the product of their individual standard deviations.
