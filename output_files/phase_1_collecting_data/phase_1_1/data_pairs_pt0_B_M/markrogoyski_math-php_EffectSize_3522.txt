     * Cohen's ƒ²
     *
     * One of several effect size measures to use in the context of an F-test
     * for ANOVA or multiple regression. Its amount of bias (overestimation of
     * the effect size for the ANOVA) depends on the bias of its underlying
     * measurement of variance explained (R², η², ω²)
