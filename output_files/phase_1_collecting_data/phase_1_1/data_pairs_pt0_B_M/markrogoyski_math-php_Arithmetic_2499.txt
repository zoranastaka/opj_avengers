     * Modulo (Binary operation)
     *
     * Modulo is different from the remainder function.
     * The PHP % operator is the remainder function, where the result has the same sign as the dividend.
     * The mod function's result has the same sign as the divisor.
     *
     * For positive dividends and divisors, the modulo function is the same as the remainder (%) operator.
     * For negative dividends or divisors, the modulo function has different behavior than the remainder (%) operator.
     *
     * a mod n
     *   a - n ⌊a/n⌋   for n ≠ 0
     *   a             for n = 0
     * where
     *   a is the dividend (integer)
     *   n is the divisor, also known as the modulus (integer)
     *   ⌊⌋ is the floor function
