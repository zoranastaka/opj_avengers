     * SSreg - The Sum Squares of the regression (Explained sum of squares)
     *
     * The sum of the squares of the deviations of the predicted values from
     * the mean value of a response variable, in a standard regression model.
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explained_sum_of_squares
     *

     * When a constant is fit to the regression, the average of y = average of ŷ.
     *
     * In the case where the constant is not fit, we use the sum of squares of the predicted value
     * SSreg = ∑ŷᵢ²
