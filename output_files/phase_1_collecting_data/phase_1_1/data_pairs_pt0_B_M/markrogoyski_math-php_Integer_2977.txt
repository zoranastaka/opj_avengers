     * If n is a perfect power, compute an m and k such that mᵏ = n.
     * A perfect power is a positive integer that can be expressed as an integer power of another positive integer.
     * If n is a perfect power, then exists m > 1 and k > 1 such that mᵏ = n.
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power
     *
     * Algorithm:
     *  For each divisor of n (as m), consider all possible values of k from 2 to log₂n.
     *   - If mᵏ = n, return m and k
     *   - If exhaust all possible mᵏ combinations, return empty array.
     *
     * An integer n could have multiple perfect power scenarios.
     * Only one is returned.
     *
     * @param  int $n
     *
     * @return array [m, k]
