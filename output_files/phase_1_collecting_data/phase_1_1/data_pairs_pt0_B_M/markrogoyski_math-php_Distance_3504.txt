     * Cosine similarity
     * A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space.
     * Defined to equal the cosine of the angle between them, which is also the same as the inner product of the same
     * vectors normalized to both have length 1.
     *
     *            A⋅B
     * cos α = ---------
     *         ‖A‖₂⋅‖B‖₂
     *
     *  where
     *    A⋅B is the dot product of A and B
     *    ‖A‖₂ is the L² norm of A
     *    ‖B‖₂ is the L² norm of B
     *
     * Similar to Python: 1 - scipy.spatial.distance.cosine(u, v, w=None)
     *
     * @param float[] $A
     * @param float[] $B
     *
     * @return float
     *
     * @throws Exception\BadDataException if null vector passed in
     * @throws Exception\VectorException
