     * Annual Nominal Rate of an annual effective rate (AER).
     * The nominal yearly rate of an annual effective rate when the
     * annual effective rate is compounded periodically within the year.
     *
     * Same as the =NOMINAL() function in most spreadsheet software.

     * See:

     *           \                 /
     *
     * Examples:
     * The nominal rate of AER 3.557% interest compounded monthly.
     *   nominal(0.03557, 12)
