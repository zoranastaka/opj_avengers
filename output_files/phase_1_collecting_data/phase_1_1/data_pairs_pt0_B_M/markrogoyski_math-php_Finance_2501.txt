     * Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) of an annual percentage rate (APR).
     * The effective yearly rate of an annual percentage rate when the
     * annual percentage rate is compounded periodically within the year.
     *
     * Same as the =EFFECT() function in most spreadsheet software.
     *
     * The formula:

     *        /     i \ á´º
     * AER = | 1 +  -  |  - 1
     *        \     n /
     *
     * Examples:
     * The AER of APR 3.5% interest compounded monthly.
     *   aer(0.035, 12)
