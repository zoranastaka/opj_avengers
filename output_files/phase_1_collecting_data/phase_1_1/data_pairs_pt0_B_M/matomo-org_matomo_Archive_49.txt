    /**
     * Queries and returns metric data in a DataTable instance.
     *
     * If multiple sites were requested in {@link build()} or {@link factory()} the result will
     * be a DataTable\Map that is indexed by site ID.
     *
     * If multiple periods were requested in {@link build()} or {@link factory()} the result will
     * be a {@link DataTable\Map} that is indexed by period.
     *
     * The site ID index is always first, so if multiple sites & periods were requested, the result
     * will be a {@link DataTable\Map} indexed by site ID which contains {@link DataTable\Map} instances that are
     * indexed by period.
     *
     * _Note: Every DataTable instance returned will have at most one row in it. The contents of each
     *        row will be the requested metrics for the appropriate site and period._
     *
     * @param string|array $names One or more archive names, eg, 'nb_visits', 'Referrers_distinctKeywords',
     *                            etc.
     * @return DataTable|DataTable\Map A DataTable if multiple sites and periods were not requested.
     *                                 An appropriately indexed DataTable\Map if otherwise.
