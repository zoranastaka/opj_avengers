/**
 * Fake scheduled actions queue for unit tests, it just records all the method calls
 * in a publicly accessible $methods_called property.
 *
 * To use:
 *
 * 1. The production class must get an instance of the queue in this way:
 *
 * WC()->get_instance_of(\WC_Queue::class)
 *
 * 2. Add the following in the setUp() method of the unit tests class:
 *
 * $this->register_legacy_proxy_class_mocks([\WC_Queue::class => new FakeQueue()]);
 *
 * 3. Get the instance of the fake queue with $this->get_legacy_instance_of(\WC_Queue::class)
 *    and check its methods_called field as appropriate.
