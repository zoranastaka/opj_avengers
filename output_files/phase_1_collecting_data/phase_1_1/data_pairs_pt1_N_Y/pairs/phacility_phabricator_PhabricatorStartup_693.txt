   * understanding their performance costs.
   *
   * Instead, the startup process marks when it enters various phases using
   * @{method:beginStartupPhase}. A later call to this method can retrieve this
   * information, which can be examined to gain greater insight into where
   * time was spent. The output is still crude, but better than nothing.
