	/**
	 * Converts a create refund request from the public API format:
	 *
	 * [
	 *   "reason" => "",
	 *   "api_refund" => "x",
	 *   "line_items" => [
	 *     "id" => "111",
	 *     "quantity" => 222,
	 *     "refund_total" => 333,
	 *     "refund_tax" => [
	 *       [
	 *          "id": "444",
	 *          "refund_total": 555
	 *       ],...
	 *   ],...
	 * ]
	 *
	 * ...to the internally used format:
	 *
	 * [
	 *   "reason" => null,     (if it's missing or any empty value, set as null)
	 *   "api_refund" => true, (if it's missing or non-bool, set as "true")
	 *   "line_items" => [     (convert sequential array to associative based on "id")
	 *     "111" => [
	 *       "qty" => 222,     (rename "quantity" to "qty")
	 *       "refund_total" => 333,
	 *       "refund_tax" => [ (convert sequential array to associative based on "id" and "refund_total)
	 *         "444" => 555,...
	 *       ],...
	 *   ]
	 * ]
	 *
	 * It also calculates the amount if missing and whenever possible, see maybe_calculate_refund_amount_from_line_items.
	 *
	 * The conversion is done in a way that if the request is already in the internal format,
	 * then nothing is changed for compatibility. For example, if the line items array
	 * is already an associative array or any of its elements
	 * is missing the "id" key, then the entire array is left unchanged.
	 * Same for the "refund_tax" array inside each line item.
	 *
	 * @param \WP_REST_Request $request The request to adjust.
