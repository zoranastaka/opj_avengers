     * Move the uploaded file to a new location.
     *
     * Use this method as an alternative to move_uploaded_file(). This method is
     * guaranteed to work in both SAPI and non-SAPI environments.
     * Implementations must determine which environment they are in, and use the
     * appropriate method (move_uploaded_file(), rename(), or a stream
     * operation) to perform the operation.
     *
     * $targetPath may be an absolute path, or a relative path. If it is a
     * relative path, resolution should be the same as used by PHP's rename()
     * function.
     *
     * The original file or stream MUST be removed on completion.
     *
     * If this method is called more than once, any subsequent calls MUST raise
     * an exception.
     *
     * When used in an SAPI environment where $_FILES is populated, when writing
     * files via moveTo(), is_uploaded_file() and move_uploaded_file() SHOULD be
     * used to ensure permissions and upload status are verified correctly.
     *
     * If you wish to move to a stream, use getStream(), as SAPI operations
     * cannot guarantee writing to stream destinations.
     *
     * @see http://php.net/is_uploaded_file
     * @see http://php.net/move_uploaded_file
     * @param string $targetPath Path to which to move the uploaded file.
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException if the $targetPath specified is invalid.
     * @throws \RuntimeException on any error during the move operation, or on
     *     the second or subsequent call to the method.
