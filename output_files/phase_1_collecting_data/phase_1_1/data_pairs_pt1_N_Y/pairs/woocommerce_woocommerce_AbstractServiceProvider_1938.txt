/**
 * Base class for the service providers used to register classes in the container.
 *
 * See the documentation of the original class this one is based on (https://container.thephpleague.com/3.x/service-providers)
 * for basic usage details. What this class adds is:
 *
 * - The `add_with_auto_arguments` method that allows to register classes without having to specify the injection method arguments.
 * - The `share_with_auto_arguments` method, sibling of the above.
 * - Convenience `add` and `share` methods that are just proxies for the same methods in `$this->getContainer()`.
