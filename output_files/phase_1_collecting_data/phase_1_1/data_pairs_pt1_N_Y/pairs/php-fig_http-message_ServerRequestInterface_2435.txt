    /**
     * Return an instance with the specified body parameters.
     *
     * These MAY be injected during instantiation.
     *
     * If the request Content-Type is either application/x-www-form-urlencoded
     * or multipart/form-data, and the request method is POST, use this method
     * ONLY to inject the contents of $_POST.
     *
     * The data IS NOT REQUIRED to come from $_POST, but MUST be the results of
     * deserializing the request body content. Deserialization/parsing returns
     * structured data, and, as such, this method ONLY accepts arrays or objects,
     * or a null value if nothing was available to parse.
     *
     * As an example, if content negotiation determines that the request data
     * is a JSON payload, this method could be used to create a request
     * instance with the deserialized parameters.
     *
     * This method MUST be implemented in such a way as to retain the
     * immutability of the message, and MUST return an instance that has the
     * updated body parameters.
     *
     * @param null|array|object $data The deserialized body data. This will
     *     typically be in an array or object.
     * @return static
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException if an unsupported argument type is
     *     provided.
