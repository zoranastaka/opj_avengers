	 * Create additional download permissions for variations if necessary.
	 *
	 * When a simple downloadable product is converted to a variable product,
	 * existing download permissions are still present in the database but they don't apply anymore.
	 * This method creates additional download permissions for the variations based on
	 * the old existing ones for the main product.
	 *
	 * The procedure is as follows. For each existing download permission for the parent product,
	 * check if there's any variation offering the same file for download (the file URL, not name, is checked).
	 * If that is found, check if an equivalent permission exists (equivalent means for the same file and with
	 * the same order id and customer id). If no equivalent permission exists, create it.
	 *
	 * @param int $product_id The id of the product to check permissions for.
