/**
 * CodeHacker - allows to hack (alter on the fly) the content of PHP code files.
 *
 * Based on BypassFinals: https://github.com/dg/bypass-finals
 *
 * How to use:
 *
 * 1. Register hacks using CodeHacker::add_hack(hack). A hack is either:
 *    - A function with 'hack($code, $path)' signature, or
 *    - An object having a public 'hack($code, $path)' method.
 *
 *    Where $code is a string containing the code to hack, and $path is the full path of the file
 *    containing the code. The function/method must return a string with the code already hacked.
 *
 * 2. Run CodeHacker::enable()
 *
 * For using with PHPUnit, see CodeHackerTestHook.
