	/**
	 * TODO - FIXME This fixes an issue with base.php that cause cyclic
	 * dependencies, especially with autoconfig setup
	 *
	 * Replace this by properly injected database connection. Currently the
	 * base.php triggers the getDatabaseConnection too early which causes in
	 * autoconfig setup case a too early distributed database connection and
	 * the autoconfig then needs to reinit all already initialized dependencies
	 * that use the database connection.
	 *
	 * otherwise a SQLite database is created in the wrong directory
	 * because the database connection was created with an uninitialized config
